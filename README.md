# ⚛️ Minimal Reack ⚛️

Minimal from-scratch setup for React with Webpack

### Quick Start

```
git clone git@github.com:stanleynguyen/minimal-reack.git <your project folder>
cd <your project folder>
rm -rf .git

Also make changes to `package.json` with regards to project details (name etc.) and
we are good to go. Happy coding~
